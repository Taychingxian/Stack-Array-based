# Stack-Array-based
This C++ code defines a simple system for managing "Happiness Index" data for different states using a stack data structure. The HIWorld class is a basic container holding a StateName (string) and its corresponding IndexHappy (float). The core logic resides in the Stack class, which implements a stack using a fixed-size array (cap_size of 5 HIWorld objects). It uses an integer top to keep track of the current position of the last element added to the stack, initializing top to -1 to signify an empty stack.

The Stack class provides standard stack operations: push to add a HIWorld object to the top, pop to remove the top object, and stackTop to view the top object without removing it. Additionally, it includes a display function to show all states currently in the stack (from top to bottom) and a getBottom function to retrieve the element at the very bottom of the stack (the first element pushed). The main function demonstrates these operations by creating HIWorld objects, pushing them onto the stack, displaying the stack's contents, and performing pop, top, and bottom retrieval operations.
